//      Exercise 1.
//      Category: problems with numerical matrixes, verification, and selection problems.
//      Championship
//      In a championship n (max 20) teams play for m (max 20) days. The outcome of the matches is stored a
//      matrix of n Ã— m integers, each of which can only be either 0, 1 or 3. Each i-th row of the matrix
//      represents the points acquired by the i-th team in the m days of the championship. Each j-th column
//      of the matrix represents the points acquired by the n teams in the matches of the j-th day. The points
//      acquired are 3 for a won game, 1 for tied and 0 for a defeat, respectively.
//      Write a program C that:
//      - acquires the content of the matrix from a text file whose name (20 characters maximum) is read from
//      the keyboard, defining a suitable format for the file. For example, you may assume that the first line
//      reports the values n and m, separated by a space, and each following line reports a row of the matrix,
//      with spaces as separators:
//
//      6 4
//      0 1 1 0
//      3 1 0 1
//      1 0 1 1
//      1 3 1 0
//      1 0 1 3
//      1 3 3 3
//
//      - for each matchday of the championship, print the index (i.e., the corresponding row number) of the
//      team that is currently leading the championship (i.e., the team that has the highest sum of points since
//      the beginning of the championship). In case there is more than one leading team, the program should
//      print the first that is found.
