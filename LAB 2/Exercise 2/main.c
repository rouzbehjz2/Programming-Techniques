//      Exercise 2.
//      Skills: Formatted IO, manipulation of numbers
//      Category: numerical problems
//      Write a C program that prints on the screen the first N numbers of Fibonacci series (N should be
//      acquired from keyboard).
//      Suggestion: Fibonacci series is 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 â€¦ It can be developed by applying the following:
//      Xi = Xi-1 + Xi-2, where X0 = 0 and X1 = 1.
//      In-depth:
//      Modify the series as follows: Xi = Xi-1 * Xi-2, with X0 = 1 and X1 = 2
//      Try to determine experimentally (i.e., by analysing the results that you obtain with increasingly
//      larger number of elements of the series) how many elements can be represented without error if
//      you use int variables or if you use unsigned int variables, respectively.
